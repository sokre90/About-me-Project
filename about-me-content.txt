About Me 

I'm an aspiring Front End developer who plays semi-pro soccer in Croatia. Besides soccer, I love to watch other sports as well, such as basketball and tennis. I also love music, pretty much everything but heavy metal. 

Genuine kindness, health and family are the three things I find very important.

I'm from Croatia but I was born in Minnesota. My entire family lives in Croatia where I grew up and where I've spent most of my life.

My work has always been my hobby. Soccer payed for my degree in psychology and after graduation I have been playing semi-pro in Germany and also Croatia where I currently am.

My dream job is to love what I do. My dream was always to play soccer for a big team, but that dream is fading. And now I'd like to be a programmer :) 

I listen to a lot of genre but recently I found an old Lenny Kravitz Greatest Hits CD so I've been jamming that in my car the last couple days.
