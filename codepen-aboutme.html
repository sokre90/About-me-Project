  <h1>More About me</h1>
  <h4>What are your favorite hobbies?</h4>
  <p>My work has always been my hobby. Soccer payed for my degree in psychology and after graduation I have been playing semi-pro in Germany and also Croatia where I currently reside. </p>
  <h4>What's your dream job?</h4>
  <p>My dream job is to love what I do. My dream has always been to play soccer for a big club, which I'm still hoping to achieve. But now I'd like to design web-pages. </p>
  <h4>What music have you been listening to lately?</h4>
  <p>I listen to a lot of genre but recently I found an old Lenny Kravitz Greatest Hits CD so I've been jamming that in my car for the last couple of days.</p>
